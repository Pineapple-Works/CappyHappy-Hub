# CappyHappy Hub

This is where you can report any bugs with CappyHappy, discuss with the community, submit feature requests, and keep up-to-date with releases. Thanks for using CappyHappy!

## Bugs/Issues

You will need a GitHub account for this. Please follow the 'issues' template and guidelines as well as you can, and provide as much relevant information as possible in an easy-to-understand format so we can fix your problem sooner.

Click on the Issues tab at the top, create a new issue, tag it accordingly, fill in the template with helpful information and submit it.

Make sure you've done some basic troubleshooting first - is it really an issue that should be fixed?

## Feature Requests

This also uses the GitHub Issues system, just with a different tag and template. You will need a GitHub account for this. Please follow the 'requests' template and guidelines as well as you can, and provide as much relevant information as possible in an easy-to-understand format so we can fix your problem sooner.

Click on the Issues tab at the top, create a new issue, tag it accordingly, fill in the template with helpful information and submit it.

Make sure you've made up your mind on exactly what you want (be specific) - we are open to many ideas, but many will still be rejected or changed.

## Discussions

You can use the GitHub Discussions tab to talk to the community! We encourage you to use the Pineapple Works Discord server instead (or as well), but if you can't, here is the place to show off things, ask for help, or just chat. Keep it respectful. If you need to contact us directly, we are also accessible via email.

## Releases

We will post info about releases here in the releases section of the repo. If you paid for CappyHappy you will get emailed releases, and if you didn't get them contact us with your purchase details.

## Pull Requests / Code Submission

This repository does not include any source code - CappyHappy is not open source. We tried GPL, but decided before release that we have financial priorities. Let us know by email if you have any concerns related to this - and if the project ever becomes abandoned we'll be sure to open-source it.

Be wary of our proprietary license - violation could mean legal consequences.

## Happy bug hunting, and we thank you for your contributions!
