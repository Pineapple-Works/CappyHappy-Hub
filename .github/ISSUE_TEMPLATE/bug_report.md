**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Not "it's broken" or "it looks weird" - something like "when Cappy poops, the pooping sound loops infinitely while continuing its behaviour, until you quit the app."

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behaviour. If possible, try to make it so these steps *always* lead to the bug (or tell us otherwise):
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. Feed the capybara
4. See error (described well above)

**Expected behaviour**
A clear and concise description of what you expect to happen (but something else happens instead).

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**System Info (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. macOS Ventura 13.2.1]
 - Device: [e.g. 2022 M2 MacBook Air 13" 8GB/256GB]
 - CappyHappy Version [e.g. v0.0.1]
 - Any other important info related to your system

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here. Be as detailed as you can, but try to only submit relevant info. If you don't know, you can probably add it (but censor out personal details.)
Include relevant logs by running the CappyHappy executable in the terminal (let us know if you need help with this)
